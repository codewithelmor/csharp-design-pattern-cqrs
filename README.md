# Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) Pattern

The **`Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern`** is a design pattern that separates the read and write operations of a system into distinct components. This pattern can be applied in various programming languages, including C#. CQRS is often used in conjunction with Event Sourcing to build scalable and maintainable systems.

Here's a basic overview of how you can implement CQRS in C#:

1. **`Commands and Command Handlers`**:
* **`Commands`**: Represent actions that change the state of the system. They are simple DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) that contain the necessary information for the action.
* **`Command Handlers`**: Responsible for executing commands. They contain the business logic for processing the command and updating the system's state.

```csharp
// Example Command
public class CreateOrderCommand
{
    public Guid OrderId { get; set; }
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    // Other command properties
}

// Example Command Handler
public class CreateOrderCommandHandler
{
    public void Handle(CreateOrderCommand command)
    {
        // Business logic to create an order
        // Update the system state
    }
}
```

1. **`Queries and Query Handlers`**:
* **`Queries`**: Represent requests for information. They are also simple DTOs but are used for reading data from the system.
* **`Query Handlers`**: Responsible for handling queries. They contain the logic for retrieving data from the system.

```csharp
// Example Query
public class GetOrderQuery
{
    public Guid OrderId { get; set; }
}

// Example Query Handler
public class GetOrderQueryHandler
{
    public OrderDto Handle(GetOrderQuery query)
    {
        // Logic to fetch order information from the system
        return new OrderDto();
    }
}
```

1. **`Command and Query Interfaces`**:
* Define interfaces for commands and queries to make it clear which operations can change the system state and which are read-only.

```csharp
// Example Command Interface
public interface ICommand
{
}

// Example Query Interface
public interface IQuery<TResult>
{
}
```

1. **`Command and Query Buses`**:
* Implement a command bus and a query bus to route commands and queries to their respective handlers.

```csharp
// Example Command Bus
public interface ICommandBus
{
    void Send<TCommand>(TCommand command) where TCommand : ICommand;
}

// Example Query Bus
public interface IQueryBus
{
    TResult Send<TQuery, TResult>(TQuery query) where TQuery : IQuery<TResult>;
}
```

1. **`Dependency Injection`**:
* Use a dependency injection container to inject the necessary dependencies (command handlers, query handlers, buses, etc.) into your application.

This is a simplified example, and in a real-world application, you may also want to consider additional concerns like validation, error handling, and asynchronous processing. Additionally, consider how events can be used to communicate changes between the write and read sides of your system.
